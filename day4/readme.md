## Python Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are anonymous functions that can contain only one expression.

    lambda arguments: expression

- no name
- one line
- no return value
- not used for code reusability

### Using lambda() Function with filter()

The `filter()` function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments. This offers an elegant way to filter out all the elements of a sequence “sequence”, for which the function returns True.

### Using lambda() Function with map()

The `map()` function in Python takes in a function and a list as an argument. The function is called with a lambda function and a list and a new list is returned which contains all the lambda modified items returned by that function for each item.

### Using lambda() Function with reduce()

The `reduce()` function in Python takes in a function and a list as an argument. The function is called with a lambda function and an iterable and a new reduced result is returned. This performs a repetitive operation over the pairs of the iterable.

## Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. U
